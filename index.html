          <strong>The benefits of indoor plants are well established.</strong>
          In addition to being a rencetly trendy decoration style, plants bring
          a unique vibration at home.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ancestral Chinese art, <em> Feng Shui</em> aims to harmonize the
          energy of a room to provide to its occupants serenity, well-being and
          harmony. This subtle and fascinating practice helps to regulate our
          polluted spaces, filled with magnetic waves, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Feng Shui plants have an energetic and stabilizing role. For example,
          in the corners of a room, they can neutralize the harmful energies
          (poisoned arrows) and help the chi to circulate. In large rooms and
          corridors these plants slow down the energy. In addition, plants
          represent the living and therefore of course a positive energy. This
          is why Feng Shui will prefer fake plants (representing a living plant)
          than dried flowers, which are the non-living version of the plant
          (dead energy).
        </p>

        <p>
          The plants will therefore vitalize and so make us swim in a chi
          regenerator very beneficial for our health. The yang energy of plants
          cleans our home, and neutralizes the possible negative energies of
          chemical and electrical pollutants, as mentioned previously.
